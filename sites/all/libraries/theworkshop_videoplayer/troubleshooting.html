			<h1>The Workshop accessible video player</h1>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Troubleshooting</h3>
			
			<h3>Step 1: Is the player visible on your page?</h3>
			<p>To check this, right click over the area where the player should be on you page. If you get a menu telling you it is Flash then the video player is being displayed.</p>
			<p>NO</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Check the URL to the video player swf</li>
					<li>Check that there are no JavaScript errors</li>
				</ul>
			
			<p>YES</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Got to the Step 2</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h3>Step 2: Can you see the video player controls?</h3>
			
			<p>If the player has loaded and initialised correctly then you will be able to see the video player controls</p>
			<p>NO</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Check the video player XML assets (videoplayer_styles.xml and video_player.xml) are all present. Use a debugger such as <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> to see if you have any 404 errors</li>
					<li>If you are using a <code>lang</code> setting, check the URLs are correct</li>
			</ul>
				
			<p>YES</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Go to Step 3</li>
			</ul>
		
			<h3>Step 3: Does the media play?</h3>
			
			<p>If the player has not loaded the media correctly you will see a spinning circle in the centre of the player. This means that the player is still trying to load the media file.</p>
			<p>NO</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Check the URLs to the media file. Use a debugger such as <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> to see if you have any 404 errors</li>
					<li>Check that the media is encoded in the correct format, flv, mp4, mp3</li>
				</ul>

			<p>YES</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You are up and running</li>
				</ul>
				
			<br/>
			<hr/>
				
			<h3>Captions/audio description not working?</h3>
			
			<p>If the player has not loaded a captions or audio description file correctly the player will not stop working, it will fail silently.</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Check the URLs to the file. Use a debugger such as <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> to see if you have any 404 errors</li>
					<li>Check there is no error in the caption XML file. Open the XML file in a browser and it will highlight any errors</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Poster image not showing?</h3>
			
			<p>If the player is not showing the poster image the player will not stop working, it will fail silently.</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Check the URLs to the file. Use a debugger such as <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> to see if you have any 404 errors</li>
				</ul>
