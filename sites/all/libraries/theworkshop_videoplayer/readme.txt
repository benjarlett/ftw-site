The Workshop Accessible media player version 0.1.0.2

Downloaded from www.theworkshop.co.uk/video-player


As a starting point, please see 'simple_example.html' as a simple way to embed the player.

For full features and configuration see 'example.html'

For a localisation/translation example see 'example_fr.html' and click the French/Englis to toggle languages
'
For an example HTML5 fallback, see 'index_html5_fallback_example.html'. This is really only if you want our content to be viewable on Browsers that do not support Flash, e.g. Mobile, iPad etc. The HTML5 fallback uses the HTML5 <video> element and therefore will not support any of the features of our Accessible Video player.
