			<strong>Transcript.</strong><br/>
			[This really should be translated also...]<br/>
			Clive: I’ve been growing giant pumpkins for about 30 years now.<br/>
			Prof Sue Hartley: And have they been getting bigger every year.<br/>
			Clive: Oh yes, with the seed selection they are getting bigger every year.<br/>
			Prof Sue Hartley: So what are the problems with growing giant pumpkins?<br/>
			Clive: Well they can explode.<br/>
			Prof Sue Hartley: That sounds very messy.<br/>
			Clive: Oh yes, I’ve had incidents myself, i watered them in the evening had a storm at night, and when I went back in the morning the pumpkin had exploded all over the garden.<br/>
			Prof Sue Hartley: Sounds very dangerous.<br/>
			Clive: Yes I believe they go off like a small grenade.<br/>
			Prof Sue Hartley: But how big can pumpkins actually get Clive? What's the limit to the size of these pumpkins?<br/>
			Clive: We just don't know, as far as I can see there’s no limit, I can see in less than 10 years time we could have pumpkins weighing up to two tonnes.<br/>
			Prof Sue Hartley: Clive can certainly grow veg, so we've got here a giant marrow with some seeds inside. <br/>
			So we can now try and get them out. Now hopefully this isn’t going to go off like a grenade. But we're going to get Alex here to chop it up for us. <br/>
			Now I have to say before Alex starts, we've been trying to keep this marrow cool and fresh since October and I have to say I’m not entirely sure how successful we've been,	it might be rather messy, hence the aprons, and I’m going to hide behind the desk. You might want to duck you guys sitting near the front Let's see what happens. <br/>
			Go for it guys. <br/>
			Oh wow! <br/>
			Thank you Alex.	<br/>
			END.
